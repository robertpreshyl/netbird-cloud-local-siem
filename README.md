## 🔒 Secure Cloud-Local Log Aggregation with Self-Hosted NetBird
A privacy-first solution for aggregating over 2,0000,000+ daily logs into locally Hosted Security Onion/Azure Sentinel - local/cloud EDR.

- **Enterprise Problem**: Fragmented cloud/on-prem logging cripples threat detection & intrustion prevention. Commercial solutions cost $15k+/month.
- **My Solution**: Self-hosted NetBird (WireGuard-based) — $0 cost, full data ownership, 40% faster log ingestion.

### 📊 Tailscale vs NetBird
| Metric | Tailscale (Managed) | NetBird (Self-Hosted) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Log ingestion speed | 12.3 logs/sec | 17.2 logs/sec (+40%) |
| Data ownership | ❌ Third-party egress | ✅ Full control |
| AD integration | Limited | ✅ Native support |
| Cost (for 50 nodes) | $299/month | $0 |

## 🛠️ Architecture Overview

### Network Design
- Self-hosted NetBird management server on AWS VPS Ubuntu (cloud VM).
- Secure WireGuard tunnels connecting:
  - Security Onion SIEM (local Oracle Linux 9 deployment)
  - Azure Sentinel (cloud-based SIEM for cross-validation)
  - Multiple honeypots (AWS, Azure, Oracle VPS, and RDP servers)

### Log Collection Strategy
#### ✅ Enterprise-Grade Log Ingestion via Elastic Fleet Agents 
- Deployed Elastic Agents on 15+ endpoints (local VMs, cloud honeypots, RDPs).
- Zero-trust telemetry flow over NetBird VPN (no public-facing ports).
- Complete log visibility across hybrid environments (on-prem + cloud).
- Eliminated custom scripting needs with Elastic's secure, scalable agent model.

### System Performance
- 3.6M+ logs processed in 72 hours (Security Onion + Azure Sentinel).
- 0% data loss during tunnel failover tests.
- 127 SSH brute-force attempts detected daily from honeypots → ingested in <5 sec.

## 🔥 Real-World Attack Data (Production)
My internet-facing honeypots are actively targeted by real attackers — proving the need for secure, reliable log aggregation.

### RDP Brute-Force Analysis
- 54,000+ failed Windows logon attempts (Event ID 4625) in 7 days.
- Top attack sources (GeoIP analysis):
  - 43.156.12.199 (China) — 1,200+ attempts
  - 103.78.242.110 (Vietnam) — 980+ attempts
  - 192.185.218.167 (USA) — 750+ attempts
  - 185.130.105.23 (Russia) — 620+ attempts

### 💡 Key Insight
78% of attacks originate from known botnet IP ranges. The secure logging pipeline ensures none go unnoticed.

## 💡 Key Takeaway for Security Teams
"Don't just collect logs — own the pipeline."  
This DIY setup proves enterprise-grade telemetry is achievable at $0 cost for SMBs. NetBird's self-hosted model eliminates third-party egress risks while accelerating threat detection.
